# Overview

Rosetta is an easy-to-use Rust [internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)
library powered by code generation. Unlike other libraries, translation files are parsed and embedded into the
resulting binary at build-time. This provide a better developer experience and reduce runtime overheat.


Using your translation files in your project is (almost) as easy as that:
```rust
rosetta_i18n::include_translations!();

println!("{}", Lang::En.hello("world"));  // Hello, world!
```

The following documentation aims to provide an exhaustive guide about using Rosetta in your project.
See [Getting started](./getting_started.md) to get an usage overview.
